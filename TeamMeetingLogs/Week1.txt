Scribe: Lance Kluge

Went over a pull request that Lance had made.

Noted that both Julia and Josh were not added as collaborators to the github repo and that issue was resolved in the meeting

Discussed if we were going to be splitting up workloads into frontend vs backend or per feature. Ended up tentatively deciding to try and split it
up front and backend.

Went over preferences about Front vs backend and decided to start that Lance, Julia, and Akshay will start on backend while Thomas and Josh will initially
start on the frontend.

Discussed the where to start for the application. Came up with the user login and user register page. Talked about needing to design the database
before we start designing the rest of the system. User table, mountain table, reviews table. 

Figured out that we don't really know what is supposed to be in milestone submissions, plan on asking TA during meeting in 5 minutes.
