Brought up a comment on Lance’s pull request:
    - Open to restructuring database for more flexibility by adding a separate table for passes. 
    - Wanted fluidity with various mountains potentially having different types of passes varying 
      from the norm.
    - More discussion and thinking needed for anything to change, not finalized.

Addressed that our database does not accommodate for external weather API calls: 
    - Decided that we should wait to implement since we don’t know what specific datapoints we 
      need/want to show 
    - Should keep in mind for the future since we have not found a weather API to implement

Discussed how to store images:
    - Store in the database either by URL or uploading the file itself to a directory. 
    - Decided that storing the files on a directory is okay to do
    - Need to figure out how to store/access images in a database with filepaths instead of URLs.
