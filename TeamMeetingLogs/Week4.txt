Meeting notes 4/14/25

Overall no major roadblocks for anyone.

What should the skeleton layout for the home page look like?
	- We can have a few cards (like we did in a previous lab) with an image and highlighted brief info for that mountain, which links to the mountain's actual page. (Drawn in miro)
	- Josh shared what home page looks like so far, also updated us that he made it in handlebars.
	- Akshay is working on the search bar.
	- Lance has written a function that can be used to make the stars div element.

Mountain page
	- Have not been able to store images on db yet, but in progress
	- Google maps is working, we just need api key that Lance set up in our env vars to use it.
	- Lance made a pull request with pretty much everything for this page, but it still needs to get real data from backend. (Akshay will get real data in this week).

If we have time, we should design a cool logo. But first we are concerned with integrating all components and testing.
